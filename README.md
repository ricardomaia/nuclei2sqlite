# Nuclei2SQLite

Script to transform the JSON output of Nuclei to a SQLite database.

## Description

This is a Node.js project that allows you to do X, Y, and Z. It takes input from a JSON file and performs specific actions based on the data provided. The program can be used for tasks like A, B, and C, making it useful for developers working on certain projects.

## Usage

Create a Nuclei scan report in JSON format.

```console
nuclei -tags cve -l targets_file.txt -j -o scan-report.json
```

The first time, run the script with the `-c` option to create the database table.

```console
node nuclei2sqlite.js -c path/to/your/scan-report.json
```

Next time this will not be necessary.

```console
node nuclei2sqlite.js path/to/your/scan-report.json
```

Replace `scan-report.json` with the actual name of your JSON file.

### Other options

```console
Usage: nuclei2sqlite [options] <json_file_path>

Transform Nuclei JSON output to SQLite database

Options:
  -c, --create  Create the database
  -d, --delete  Delete existing records from the database
